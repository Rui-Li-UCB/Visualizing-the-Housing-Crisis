            And yet historical practices of redlining, zoning policy, evictions,
            displacement, rising rents, and lack of affordable housing are just
            some of the elements that contribute to the “housing crisis.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether or not you've heard of this term, you might be aware of some
            of these elements that make this such a complex problem. The legacy
            of segregation-based practices and policy contributes to the
            continuation of racial inequity in housing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the past will help us contextualize the present and
            work towards a better future— by learning more about this crisis, we
            hope to encourage more nuanced discussions.

            Richmond presents a compelling case study to understand the housing
            crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located in the East San Francisco Bay Area, the city has been
            racially and economically diverse since its founding. Like many
            cities, Richmond has its own fault lines. There’s a history of
            housing inequity dating back to pre-WWII and a large corporate
            industry presence, both of which have contributed to early stages of
            gentrification and displacement of the city’s Black population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Richmond has a unique history, the housing problems faced by
            there echo across many major American cities. Therefore, the story
            we set out to tell will be set in Richmond, but we hope learning
            about what has led to the housing crisis in a specific context can
            help with understanding this issue in its entirety.

        <h2>Living in Richmond is Not the Same for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
          Today in Richmond, life looks different based simply on where people
          live. By examining disparities between White and Black populations of
          the city stemming from housing-related factors-including zoning,
          evictions, and home ownership-you will see these critical disparities
          clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          These disparities all equal the housing crisis, and by learning about
          them, their history, and effects, you are undoing the system as we
          strive for something better.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Housing Today: Different Realities</h3>
        <p>
          Zoning laws define land use into categories such as commercial,
          residential, or mixed (commercial and residential) use. Often highly
          prescriptive, they specify which kinds of homes can be built and where
          - for example, single-family homes with a certain setback as opposed
          to dense, multi-family apartment complexes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Research by the Othering and Belonging Institute finds that residents
          of single-family zones have access to better schools, cleaner water,
          lower exposure to pollutants, higher incomes, lower property, and
          higher property values. In fact, they state, “...cities with high
          levels of single-family zoning have greater resources in virtually
          every statistic we are able to measure.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The following data visualizations stress the dramatic differences
          between Richmond’s white and black populations, exacerbated by
          restrictive zoning, and make the case for reversing this impact.

    <div class="section_wide">
      <div class="content_wide">
        <h3>Renting vs. Owning: Building Generational Wealth</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding homeownership versus renting is important because it
          provides insight into who has access to the benefits that come with
          generational wealth. Owning a home can provide greater stability than
          renting in respect to staying in a community, and property taxes from
          homes provide funding for better education and other public services.
          In California as a whole, homeownership has often been restricted to
          wealthy white neighborhoods and maintained through policies such as
          Proposition 13, which defines changes in property tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of owning, White residents own homes at more than 2x Black
          residents and 1.3x Hispanic residents. For renting, Hispanic residents
          rent almost 2x more and Black residents rent around 1.5x more than
          White residents.
        </p>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Evictions -->
    <div class="section_wide">
      <div class="content_wide">
        <h3>Evictions</h3>
        <p>
          In a legal eviction, someone is ordered by a court to leave their
          residence. Eviction is one of the most common methods of displacement,
          which is when a resident is forced to move against their will.
          Displacement can have negative effects ranging from worse physical and
          mental health, more emergency room visits, lower educational outcomes
          for children, food insecurity, to higher rates of future homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using data on writs of restitution (when a tenant is officially
          removed from their home by the county sheriff after losing an eviction
          case) served from January 2017 to March 2022, the Eviction Research
          Network finds that there are significant racial disparities in
          evictions in Richmond. Note that this dataset is a severe undercount
          of the actual number of evictions occurring, but it is still
          representative of a larger trend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is evicted is related to one’s socioeconomic and geographic
          reality. All of these factors are tied with financial instability and
          housing vulnerability, which experiencing an eviction exacerbates.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section_narrow" style="margin-top: 0">
      <div class="content_narrow">
        <div class="blank"></div>
        <div class="blank_sm"></div>
        <p>
          As seen in this map, the neighborhoods with the highest levels of
          recorded evictions are the Iron Triangle, Panhandle, and Hilltop.
          These neighborhoods are predominantly Black and Hispanic. The current
          housing landscape places the vulnerable - who are often racial
          minorities - in precarious situations rather than support them.

          Much of the racial disparity in housing is due to the historical

        </h3>
        <p>
          Redlining was the discriminatory practice by banks and government
          agencies of denying or withholding home loans in “red” (“hazardous” )
          neighborhoods in terms of “mortgage security”. This process excluded
          racial minorities, especially Black residents, by limiting their
          access to home loans. This process segregated cities by concentrating
          Black families into neighborhoods with lower financial investment,
          separated from White neighborhoods.

            "A"—colored green on the maps—were deemed minimal risks for banks
            and other mortgage lenders when they were determining who should
            received loans and which areas in the city were safe investments.
            Those receiving the lowest grade of "D," colored red, were
            considered "hazardous."

          Now that we understand some of the issues, it is important to ask: how

          Rothstein’s novel tells the story of Richmond’s residents who moved to
          Richmond for work and saw the city’s population boom. Prior to World
          War 2, Richmond was a small, predominantly agricultural area.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as the shipyards ran out of White workers, Black workers from
          the South moved to Richmond in large numbers. However, segregated
          public housing and other racially based practices impacted where these
          residents could live. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After the war, the population boom slowed as the government tore down
          its housing projects. Richmond then became an oil town, still with
          racial disparities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, we break down a series of historical events that explains the
          issues Rothstein discusses, how segregation became entrenched in the
          city, and how housing could not keep up with the demand.

          You might be thinking, how are these problems still prevalent today?
          Why aren't they being dealt with? Why don't we just build more
          housing?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, there are many reasons and perspectives in potential solutions.
        </p>
        <p>Let's start with the perspectives from developers.</p>
      </div>

          Problems surrounding development today
        </h2>
        <p>
          Multifamily developments must adhere to a variety of regulations in
          order to protect the health and safety of residents, and ensure the
          integrity of the building and surrounding area. While certain
          regulations are very important, it is important to consider that each
          regulation comes at an expense to the project and developer, who then
          in turn increase rents in order to maintain financial feasibility. At
          present, regulation compliance constitutes an average of 40% of a
          project's total development costs, a high percentage considering the
          cost of land, labor, and materials. Conflicting standards across
          regulations and time consuming review processes are costly both in
          terms of time and money. This in turn can limit who can afford to
          develop housing. Increasingly, development is being conducted by large
          corporations who have greater access to funding to be able to afford
          the cost of holding onto land through delays, rather than by smaller
          scale developers who may want to invest in the community.

        <p>
          There are no quick fixes to the housing crisis affecting residents in
          Richmond and beyond. We've summarized several approaches being pursued
          by people across policy, advocacy, and grassroots/community. However,
          we definitely need movement across all of these areas and more.

          This is a big problem space with no one “one size fits all” solution.
          When you think of all the work that needs to be done to help fix this
          problem, it might seem like a maze trying to find where to begin.

        <p>
          Well, you just took the first step, empowering action by understanding
          the history that led to the housing crisis, how it manifests today,
          and what solutions might look like.

        <p>
          Creating informed citizens will lead to informed action, action that
          can make a difference.
