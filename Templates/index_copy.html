            And yet historical practices of redlining, zoning policy, evictions,
            displacement, rising rents, and lack of affordable housing are just
            some of the elements that contribute to the “housing crisis.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether or not you've heard of this term, you might be aware of some
            of these elements that make this such a complex problem.The legacy
            of segregation-based practices and policy contributes to the
            continuation of racial inequity in housing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the past will help us contextualize the present and
            work towards a better future— by learning more about this crisis, we
            hope to encourage more nuanced discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first step in making this happen, so let's get started.

        <h2>Welcome to Richmond, CA</h2>
        <div class="main_p">
          <p>
            Richmond presents a compelling case study to understand the housing
            crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located in the East San Francisco Bay Area, the city has been
            racially and economically diverse since its founding. Like many
            cities, Richmond has its own fault lines. There’s a history of
            housing inequity dating back to pre-WWII and a large corporate
            industry presence, both of which have contributed to early stages of
            gentrification and displacement of the city’s Black population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Richmond has a unique history, the housing problems faced by
            there echo across many major American cities. Therefore, the story
            we set out to tell will be set in Richmond, but we hope learning
            about what has led to the housing crisis in a specific context can
            help with understanding this issue in its entirety.

          <div id="rch_disp">
            <p>
              Today in Richmond, life looks different based simply on where
              people live. By examining disparities between White and Black
              populations of the city stemming from housing-related
              factors-including zoning, evictions, and home ownership-you will
              see these critical disparities clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
              These disparities all equal the housing crisis, and by learning
              about them, their history, and effects, you are undoing the system
              as we strive for something better.

          <h3>Zoning</h3>
          <p>
            Zoning laws define land use into categories such as commercial,
            residential, or mixed (commercial and residential) use. Often highly
            prescriptive, they also specify which kinds of homes can be built
            and where - for example, single-family homes with a certain setback
            as opposed to dense, multi-family apartment complexes.
          </p>
          <p>This is the City of Richmond’s current zoning map.</p>

          <h3>This is the racial composition of Richmond in 2021.</h3>
          <p>
            As seen in South Richmond, the areas where the city placed temporary
            war housing projects - which housed the majority of shipyard
            workers, who were Black - still remain Black neighborhoods. Beyond
            Richmond, zoning ordinances have been a means of exclusion; it
            encodes in geographic reality the concentration of people of color
            into certain housing types, and parts of the city.
          </p>

          <p class="emphasis_p">
            Much of the racial disparity in housing is due to the historical
            legacy and practice of redlining in the Bay Area.

    <!-- Redlining -->

      <div id="redlining" class="content">
        <div class="main_p">
          <p>
            Redlining was the discriminatory practice by banks and government
            agencies of denying or withholding home loans in “red” (“hazardous”
            ) neighborhoods in terms of “mortgage security”. This process
            excluded racial minorities, especially Black residents, from
            accessing mortgage opportunities in “green” (“safe investment”) and
            thus excluding them from living in such neighborhoods and
            concentrating them into neighborhoods with lower investment. This is
            an example of a redlining map for nearby Oakland, Berkeley, and
            other cities.
          </p>
          <p class="emphasis_p">
            Zoning, then, is often correlated with redlined and segregated
            neighborhoods. Studies from the Othering and Belonging Institute
            show that single-family zoning is strongly correlated with
            neighborhood characteristics that have a direct impact on residents.

            Residents of single-family zones have access to better schools,
            cleaner water, lower exposure to pollutants, higher incomes, lower
            property, and higher property values. In fact, they state,<a

        <h2>Evictions</h2>
        <div class="main_p">
          <p>
            When someone is legally evicted, they are ordered by the court to
            leave their residence. Using data from the Eviction Research Network
            on writs of restitution (when a tenant is officially removed from
            their home by the county sheriff after losing their eviction case)
            served from January 2017 to March 2022, we find that there are
            racial disparities in evictions in Richmond. As with zoning, who is
            evicted is related to one’s socioeconomic and geographic reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            As seen in this map, the neighborhoods with the highest levels of
            measured evictions are the Iron Triangle, Panhandle, and Hilltop.
            These neighborhoods are predominantly Black and Hispanic. The
            current housing landscape places the vulnerable - who are often
            racial minorities - in precarious situations rather than support
            them.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Can public policy reduce this racial disparity? Past research shows
            that eviction is linked with worse physical and mental health, more
            emergency room visits, lower educational outcomes for children, food
            insecurity, and higher rates of future homelessness. All of these
            factors are tied with financial instability, which experiencing an
            eviction exacerbates. This is why federal, state, and local
            governments instituted moratoria on eviction in the early days of
            the COVID-19 pandemic.

            This graph shows that, while public policy is effective in reducing
            evictions, it did not fully address the racial disparities that
            exist in Richmond. In 2017, there were 3.5 Black evictions and 2.5
            Hispanic evictions for every 1 White eviction. In 2021, that value
            changed to 4 Latine evictions for every 1 White eviction, while
            Black eviction rates stayed the same.
